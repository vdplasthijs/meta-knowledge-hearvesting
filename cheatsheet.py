In scientific meta-analyses that explore how climate change affects crop yields,
the relationships between variables like crop yield and climate drivers are 
deeply interconnected—and critically shaped by the time and location of the
experiments.

Crops have many type, and each crop exhibits distinct phenological development characteristics
throughout its growth cycle. These developmental stages—such as germination, vegetative growth,
flowering, and maturation—vary in duration and intensity depending on the crop species and
environmental conditions. The differences in phenological development directly influence
the biomass accumulation, resource allocation, and ultimately the formation of yield. As a result,
each crop type produces different levels of yield under given conditions. 

Different crops exhibit distinct yield responses depending on the climate driver they
face, such as elevated temperatures, CO₂ concentrations, drought, or combinations of these.
For instance, crops like wheat and rice tend to show greater sensitivity to heat and CO₂
changes compared to crops like maize and sorghum, which are more resilient in hot, arid
climates. 

The yield outcome also hinges on the timing of exposure to stress—especially during critical
developmental phases like anthesis and grain filling. For example, heat stress during anthesis
can cause a 30% reduction in crop yield, and the reduction is 10% in C4 crops. This highlights
the importance of not only the stress type but also when it occurs within the crop’s lifecycle.

Moreover, the location of an experiment determines the ambient climate baseline, which affects
how far or close conditions are to a crop's optimal temperature range. This regional variability
means that even the same crop can exhibit different yield responses in different climates or
growing zones. For example, a degree of warming that harms yields in one area might have a
neutral or even beneficial effect in another, depending on local conditions.

Importantly, yield response isn’t always driven by single climate factors. The interaction of
multiple stressors—like heat and drought occurring together—often has a more severe effect than
each factor alone. These compound effects can reduce cereal grain yields by up to 60%, compared
to 30–40% for single stress events. Such outcomes can also vary by crop species and depend on
cultivar-specific traits, as well as soil conditions and water availability.

Experimental design adds another layer of complexity. Controlled settings like FACE or open-top
chambers simulate specific climate conditions to isolate variables, but their findings must be
interpreted in the context of real-world environmental variability, where multiple stressors may
co-occur unpredictably.

Ultimately, any accurate interpretation of climate impact on crop yield must take into account
not just the type of crop and climate variable involved, but also where and when the crop was
grown, what combinations of stressors were presentd. These interdependent relationships form the 
backbone of agricultural meta-analysis and are key to projecting how global food systems may evolve 
in a changing climate.

- Metadata date: This element contains the date on which the metadata was created or updated. The
    date format is YYYY-MM-DD (with hyphens).
- Metadata language: This element records the language in which the metadata is written. It contains
    the code of the language used in the metadata text. Only the three-letter codes from ISO 639-2/B
    (bibliographic codes) should be used, as defined in ISO 639-2. The code for Dutch is "dut".
- Responsible organization metadata: This element contains the name of the organization responsible
    for the metadata. Use the full written name of the responsible organization. An abbreviation may
    be added to the organization name. For correct official government organization names, refer to
    the list of government organizations. Preferably, fill in this element as a gmx:Anchor, where the
    href attribute points to a URI that describes the organization.

- Landing page: A Web page that can be navigated to in a Web browser to gain access to the catalog, 
    dataset, its distributions and/or additional information.
- Title: A name given to the resource.
- Description: A free-text account of the resource.
- Unique Identifier: A unique identifier of the resource being described or cataloged. The identifier
    is a text string which is assigned to the resource to provide an unambiguous reference within a
    particular context.
- Resource type: The nature or genre of the resource. The value SHOULD be taken from a well governed
    and broadly recognised controlled vocabulary, such as:
        DCMI Type vocabulary [DCTERMS]
        [ISO-19115-1] scope codes
        Datacite resource types [DataCite]
        PARSE.Insight content-types used by re3data.org [RE3DATA-SCHEMA] (see item 15 contentType)
        MARC intellectual resource types
    Some members of these controlled vocabularies are not strictly suitable for datasets or data
    services (e.g., DCMI Type Event, PhysicalObject; [ISO-19115-1] CollectionHardware, CollectionSession,
    Initiative, Sample, Repository), but might be used in the context of other kinds of catalogs defined
    in DCAT profiles or applications.
- Keywords: A keyword or tag describing the resource.
- Data creator: The entity responsible for producing the resource.
- Data contact point: Relevant contact information for the cataloged resource. Use of vCard is recommended
    [VCARD-RDF]. 
- Data publisher: The entity responsible for making the resource available. Resources of type foaf:Agent
    are recommended as values for this property.
- Spatial coverage: The geographical area covered by the dataset. The spatial coverage of a dataset may be
    encoded as an instance of dcterms:Location, or may be indicated using an IRI reference (link) to a
    resource describing a location. It is recommended that links are to entries in a well maintained
    gazetteer such as Geonames.
- Spatial resolution: Minimum spatial separation resolvable in a dataset, measured in meters. If the
    dataset is an image or grid this should correspond to the spacing of items. For other kinds of spatial
    datasets, this property will usually indicate the smallest distance between items in the dataset.
- Spatial reference system: This element contains the Alphanumeric value that indicates the reference system
    used for the dataset. EPSG issues these codes. For the RD, the code 28992 is used. The reference system
    is included with a URI that also contains the code.
    Example: source:
        <gmx:Anchor
        xlink:href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992">RD
        </gmx:Anchor>

- Temporal coverage: The temporal period that the dataset covers. An interval of time that is named or
    defined by its start and end dates.
- Temporal resolution: Minimum time period resolvable in the dataset. If the dataset is a time-series this
    should correspond to the spacing of items in the series. For other kinds of dataset, this property will
    usually indicate the smallest time difference between items in the dataset.
- License: A legal document under which the resource is made available.
- Access rights: Information about who can access the resource or an indication of its security status.
- Distribution access URL: 	A URL of the resource that gives access to a distribution of the dataset.
    E.g., landing page, feed, SPARQL endpoint.
    dcat:accessURL SHOULD be used for the URL of a service or location that can provide access to this
    distribution, typically through a Web form, query or API call.
    dcat:downloadURL is preferred for direct links to downloadable resources.
    If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a landing page (i.e., direct download URLs are not
    known), then the landing page URL associated with the dcat:Dataset SHOULD be duplicated as access URL
    on a distribution (see 5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page).
- Distribution format: The file format of the distribution.  dcat:mediaType SHOULD be used if the type of
    the distribution is defined by IANA [IANA-MEDIA-TYPES].
- Distribution byte size: The size of a distribution in bytes. The size in bytes can be approximated (as
    a non-negative integer) when the precise size is not known. While it is recommended that the size be
    given as an integer, alternative literals such as '1.5 MB' are sometimes used.
